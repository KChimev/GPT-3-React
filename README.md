A React application made to be responsive on all devices including phones and tablets.
To complete this project I had to create reusable components which receive styles and information through props.
The project used a lot of css practices such as flex and grid, media queries and reusable variables.
This app is deployed on netlify at https://gpt3-project-konstantin.netlify.app/
